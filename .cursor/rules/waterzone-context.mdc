# Waterzone

This workspace is the **Waterzone** project (folder: "Waterzone Dummy"). It includes a mobile app (Expo/React Native) and a backend.

## Resuming in a new chat

When starting a new chat or returning to the project, you can say:

- **"Continue working on Waterzone"** — to pick up from where you left off
- **"Waterzone: [what you want to do next]"** — to give context and the next task in one go

Using "Waterzone" in the first message helps the AI recognize the project and load relevant context.
